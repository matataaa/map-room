## OpenStreetMap Americana

Map Room packages the generated StyleJSON, sprite atlas, shield definitions,
and shield-rendering runtime from
[OpenStreetMap Americana](https://github.com/osm-americana/openstreetmap-americana)
at commit `6098606aae8119de34a5de08e7bedc1ffdd712a8`. OpenStreetMap Americana is
dedicated to the public domain under CC0-1.0. Map Room preserves its actual
layer hierarchy and visual assets while rewriting the tile, sprite, glyph, and
shield locations to self-hosted Map Room resources. Americana font families
are mapped to Map Room's locally packaged Open Sans glyphs, and its external
terrain source is omitted so the style remains usable on offline networks.

The complete upstream license text and provenance record are included under
`styles/vendor/americana/`.

## MapLibre GL JS

Map Room's browser setup copies MapLibre GL JS, version 6.9.0, into the local
runtime bundle. MapLibre GL JS is distributed under the BSD 3-Clause License
and includes code under additional compatible notices. The setup command copies
the dependency's complete `LICENSE.txt` alongside the browser bundle as
`web/vendor/MapLibre-LICENSE.txt`.
